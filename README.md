# Getting Started with Create React App

In this WebApp I have use some dummy data for coffee.

I have implement Login andlogout functionality in which i have also put restriction to visit another page without login.

I have implemented add to cart functionality which sore each item to cart and we can also see cart data even if we logout and again login to site.

We can also add indivisual item from cart if we want more quantity of that item.

User will autometically logout after 1 hour if he will not do any activity.

And I have also add some css propety to make WebApp more interective
